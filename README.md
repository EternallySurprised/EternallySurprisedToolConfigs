# Sven's Config Files

Hi, folks,

I'm Sven, an engineer and developer from Germany. I love to explore and learn and break stuff in the process.

This Repository contains my personal config files for various tools. It will grow over time and potentially become more specific to me and less useful to you. But I guess you can build upon what I put here.

> :warning: Products change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases as I use the tools, but I am not responsible if stuff breaks on your end. So: Use your own brain when (re)using my configs.

## Nerd-Fonts

To display icons in terminal or applications Fonts, I'm using [Nerd-Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com), specifically the **Fira Code** in my terminal as well as in VS Code.
